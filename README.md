12/07/21
this is just me practicing adding and committing.
get used to the feeling 

git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages wasnt working
    error 403 returned
        had to update github's pw in windows credential manager to new public access token
git push wasn't working again
    current branch was behind gh-pages
        had to relearn 
        git fetch origin gh-pages
        git pull origin gh-pages
    

i think i got it
just practicing getting back into the flow of it.
